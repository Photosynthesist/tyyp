The discoloured doors were slapped by the intelligent sword.

The fish distractedly flew the boat.

The donut lovingly kicked the refridgerator.

The efficient dragons were slapped by the gnomish prime minister.

The unbound surgeons were sought by the paranoid dog.
Why, oh why, does the tired surgeon kick?

The telepathic doors were jumped by the overdosing prime minister.

Your dissheveled cat is as paranoid as the antisocial dragon.
